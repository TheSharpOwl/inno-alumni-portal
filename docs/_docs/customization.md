The project architecture outlines the overall structure and organization of the Alumni Portal. It describes how the frontend and backend components interact, including data flow and communication protocols.

### Technologies <a name="technologies"></a>

This section lists the technologies and frameworks utilized in the development of the Alumni Portal. Key technologies include Python FastAPI for the backend, Next.js for the frontend, Docker for containerization, and PostgreSQL for the database.

## Project Setup <a name="setup"></a>

This section details the steps required to set up the development environment for the Alumni Portal project, including installation of dependencies and configuration of environment variables.

### Requirements <a name="reqs"></a>

The requirements section specifies the necessary dependencies and packages needed to run the Alumni Portal project. Instructions for installing these dependencies using tools like pip and npm are provided.

### Environment Variables <a name="env"></a>

Environment variables are essential configuration settings that control the behavior of the application. This section outlines the required environment variables for the frontend and backend components of the Alumni Portal.

## Frontend <a name="frontend"></a>

The frontend section focuses on the development aspects related to the user interface and client-side logic of the Alumni Portal.

### Directory Structure <a name="structure"></a>

The directory structure defines how the frontend codebase is organized, including folders for components, pages, styles, and utilities.

### State Management <a name="state"></a>

State management is crucial for managing application state across components. This section discusses the state management approach used in the frontend of the Alumni Portal, whether it's through React's built-in state management or external libraries like Redux.

### API Integration <a name="front-api"></a>

API integration involves communicating with the backend server to fetch and update data. This section explains how the frontend interacts with the backend APIs using HTTP requests, AJAX, or GraphQL.

## Backend <a name="backend"></a>

The backend section covers the server-side development aspects of the Alumni Portal project.

### Structure of FastAPI application <a name="back-struct"></a>

FastAPI is used to build the backend server for the Alumni Portal. This section outlines the structure of a FastAPI application, including routers, controllers, middleware, and request handling.

### Routing and Controllers <a name="routers"></a>

Routing and controllers are essential for defining API endpoints and handling incoming requests. This section explains how routing and controllers are implemented in the FastAPI backend of the Alumni Portal.

### Database Models <a name="models"></a>

Database models represent the structure of data stored in the database. This section describes the database models used in the backend of the Alumni Portal, including entities, relationships, and schema definitions.

Sure, here's the description for each section:

## Authentication and Authorization <a name="security"></a>

The Authentication and Authorization section focuses on the security aspects of the Alumni Portal project, particularly regarding user authentication and authorization.

### JWT Authentication <a name="jwt-auth"></a>

JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication is utilized to verify the identity of users accessing the Alumni Portal. This section explains how JWT tokens are generated, issued, and validated to authenticate users.

### Authorization Middleware <a name="middleware-auth"></a>

Authorization middleware is implemented to control access to specific routes and functionalities within the Alumni Portal based on user roles and permissions. This section describes how middleware is used to enforce access control policies and protect sensitive resources.

## API Documentation <a name="api-docs"></a>

The API Documentation section provides comprehensive documentation for the backend APIs exposed by the Alumni Portal. It includes details about API endpoints, request parameters, response formats, and authentication requirements.
